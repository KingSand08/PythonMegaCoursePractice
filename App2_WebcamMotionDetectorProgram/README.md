# PythonMegaCoursePractice: App 1: Webcam Motion Detector Program
This app was written using Python and the ```cv2```, ```time```, ```pandas```, and ```datetime``` modules. The purpose of this app is to ...:
* Utilize the computer's camera
* Track any motion caught on screen, comparing it to the first image
* Store the motion caught to a cvs file called ```motion_capture_times.csv```

To run this program, start the ```motionDetector.py``` file. Then to get data from interactions caught on screen stop the program, and a csv should be generated for you. This program will still work even if the csv is deleted, as a new one will generate and overwrite the old one regardless.
