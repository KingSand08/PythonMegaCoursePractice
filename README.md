# PythonMegaCoursePractice
Following the online course "The Python Mega Course: Build 10 Real World Applications", this repository will comprise the 10 apps developed. 

Projects have been modified and added onto by the developer. Each app will be in its own directory along with a ```README``` and any necessary instructions to run the app.
