# Python Mega Course Practice -> App 3: Data Analysis and Visualisation with Pandasa and Matplotlib
This app was written using Python and the ```justpy```, ```pandas```, ```datetime```, ```pytz```, and ```matplotlib.pyplot``` modules. The purpose of this app is to create webpages that will display graphical information about reviews (which are sourced from "The Python Mega Course: Build 10 Real Applications" Udemy Course). Specifically, this app:
* Creates a series of webpages (utilizing ```justpy```)
* Each webpage contains an interative graph representing review data
* Contains a ```practice_files``` directory, with a comprhensive breakdown all the data available through the webapges

The graphs used are dirivative/manipulated versions of what may be found as of August 2024 on https://www.highcharts.com/demo/highcharts. The graphs used include, spline, stream, and pi. A note about this app is that webpages utlize justpy, pandas, datetime, and the practice files utilize everything else to render/plot the data. The data is also located in two directories for ease of use. The first is the ```data``` directory, this is for the webpages to use. The other directory is within the practice_files, so relative path is ```./practice_files/data/```, and is used for the practice files *.ipynb files. It is recommended to launch ```jupyter notebook``` from the sub-directory ```./practice_files/```. Relative means within the App 3 scope, not the Python Mega Course Practice scope.
